Security in Banking and Payments

Ensuring the security of financial transactions and customer data is paramount for banks and payment systems. Various measures are implemented to protect against fraud, cyberattacks, and unauthorized access.

Security Measures in Banking:
- Encryption: Protecting sensitive data during transmission and storage.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requiring multiple verification steps to access accounts or authorize transactions.
- Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems: Preventing unauthorized access to bank networks.
- Fraud Monitoring Systems: Detecting suspicious activities and alerting banks and customers.
- Biometric Authentication: Using unique biological traits (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition) for verification.
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS): Protocols for secure communication over the internet.

Security Measures in Payments:
- Tokenization: Replacing sensitive card details with unique tokens for transactions.
- EMV Chip Technology: Enhancing the security of card payments through embedded microchips.
- Payment Gateways with Security Protocols: Ensuring secure processing of online payments.
- Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): Requiring additional verification for online transactions.
- Regular Security Audits and Compliance Standards (e.g., PCI DSS).

Customer Responsibilities:
- Protecting login credentials and PINs.
- Being cautious of phishing scams and suspicious emails/messages.
- Regularly monitoring account activity.
- Reporting any unauthorized transactions immediately.
